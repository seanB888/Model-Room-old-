## About 3D Objects
When choosing a 3D object, Swift works with .usdz file format. Try and also choose PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) format, these objects have a more realistic look to them.

### The 3D assets should meet these requirements if possible
- USDZ Format
- PBR Materials/Textures
- PBR Metal/Roughness Workflow

### View the 3D Assets
- Finder
- Xcode 3D Assets Viewer (built in xcode)
- Reality Converter
- PhotoShop (to remove background and create .PNG thumbnails)
